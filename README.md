# ets2-optionalizer
ETS2 and ATS python script that lets you mark mods as optional.

You can download it from [Releases](https://github.com/Variapolis/ets2-optionalizer/releases/tag/Release). Or run the python script yourself. Relies on curses, (windows-curses if you're on Windows), and tkinter. Converted to an exe using auto-py-to-exe from pypi.
